# Day10 - Amicable Pair Check
> Write a C program to check whether the entered pair of numbers are Amicable numbers or not?
> What is Amicable Pair?
```
let's consider 2 numbers A & B, first you need to generate the proper divisors of A, then sum it, then generate the proper divisors of B, then sum it, if A's sum of proper divisors equals to B and B's sum of proper divisors equals to A means we can call the pair of numbers as Amicable Pair. 
Eg: A=220 and B=284
They are amicable pair because the proper divisors of 220 are 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 11, 20, 22, 44, 55 and 110, of which the sum is 284; and the proper divisors of 284 are 1, 2, 4, 71 and 142, of which the sum is 220.

# Day91 - Largest Palindromic Number
> Write a C program to find Largest Palindromic Number by permuting digits.

> Given a very large input N, the task is to print the largest palindromic number obtained by permuting the digits of N.

> If it is not possible to make a palindromic number, then print “Palindrome cannot be formed”

```
For Example
if the input is 313551, then the output is 531135, because 531135 is the largest number which is a palindrome, 135531, 315513 and other numbers can also be formed but we need the highest of all of the palindromes.
```
### [Code_day91.c](https://github.com/sanjaysanju618/100-Days-of-Code/blob/main/day091.c)

# Output:-
```
Enter a number
531135

```

# Day94 - Circular Prime
> Write a C program to check whether the given number is circular prime number or not and also generate the circular prime numbers from 1 to 1000.

> A circular prime is a prime number with the property that the number generated at each intermediate step when cyclically permuting its (base 10) digits will be prime.

> For example, 1193 is a circular prime, since 3119, 9311 and 1931 are prime numbers.
### [Code_day94.c](https://github.com/sanjaysanju618/100-Days-of-Code/blob/main/day094.c)

# Output:-
```
Choose the option
 1.Check Circular Prime
 2.Generate Circular Prime numbers between 1 & 1000
 3.Exit
1
Enter a number
131

the entered number is a circular prime number
```

# Day95 - Narcissistic Decimal Numbers
> Write a C program to check whether the given number is Narcissistic Decimal Number or not and also generate first 15 Narcissistic Decimal Numbers. 

> Narcissistic Number is a number that is the sum of its own digits each raised to the power of the number of digits.

> for example, 1634 is Narcissistic Number, because 1^4 + 6^4 + 3^4 + 4^4 = 1634.
### [Code_day95.c](https://github.com/sanjaysanju618/100-Days-of-Code/blob/main/day095.c)

# Output:-
```
Choose the option
 1.Check Narcissistic Number
 2.Generate first 15 Narcissistic Numbers
 3.Exit
1
Enter a number
153
the entered number is a Narcissistic Number
```

# Day96 - Automorphic Number
> Write a C program to check whether the given number is Automorphic Number or not and also generate Automorphic Numbers between 1 & 1000. 

> A number is called Automorphic number if and only if its square ends in the same digits as the number itself.

> for example, 76 is Automorphic Number, because 76 * 76 = 5776.
### [Code_day96.c](https://github.com/sanjaysanju618/100-Days-of-Code/blob/main/day096.c)

# Output:-
```
Choose the option
 1.Check Automorphic Number
 2.Generate Automorphic Numbers between 1 & 1000
 3.Exit
 2
Automorphic Numbers between 1 & 1000 are
1 5 6 25 76 376 625 
```

# Day97 - Pangram
> Write a C program to display missing characters to make a string pangram.

> Pangram is a sentence containing every letter in the english alphabet. Given a string, find all characters that are missing from the string, i.e., the characters that can make string a pangram.

> The output should be in alphabetic order.
